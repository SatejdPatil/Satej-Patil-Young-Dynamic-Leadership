It is quite an interesting, challenging and satisfying responsibility to work as the Minister of State, Government of Maharashtra. I am highly obliged and thankful to Hon Smt. Soniaji Gandhi, Hon Shri Rahulji Gandhi for their guidance and support. Also I am grateful to the Chief Minister Hon. Shri Prithviraj Chavan and all my seniors at Congress who have shown faith in me and my working abilities. I am committed to take a stand against whatever is wrong in the society and strive to achieve betterment of society. I seek to tread the path of dialogue and cooperation and work together with all citizens to build a new and bright future not only for Maharashtra or for India but for the whole Humanity. To this eternal quest of Social Service I pledge my devotion, commitment and my life. Do keep your blessing and wishes with me.
